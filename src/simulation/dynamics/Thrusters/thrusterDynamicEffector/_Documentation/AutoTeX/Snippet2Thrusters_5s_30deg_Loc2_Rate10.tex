The first thruster is set at 30$^\circ$ off the x-axis 15$^\circ$ off the z-axis, in the position $\bm r = \left(1.125,0.5,2.0\right)$. The second thruster is set at 75$^\circ$ off the x-axis 60$^\circ$ off the z-axis, in the position $\bm r = \left(1.0,0.0,0.0\right)$. The test uses these 2 thrusters for 5.0 seconds. The test rate is 10 steps per second
